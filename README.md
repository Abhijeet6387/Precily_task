UI Task (MERN)<br/>
Live At - https://uitaskprecily.herokuapp.com/ <br/>
The purpose of the repository is to contain the code that has been written in order to complete the task based on MERN Stack.

<b>Key Features </b><br/>
-> It consists of three div layouts.<br/>
-> All the div's are adjustable in accordance to each other as given in the first task.<br/>
-> The First div consists two options as radio button : add and update; If a user wishes to add some text to the card in the bottom most div, they can write some text in the description box and click on the <strong>ADD</strong> button.<br/>
-> The text will be updated in the card below and the Add Count is increased.<br/>
-> Further, If the user wants to update an existing text, they can switch to the update radio button where they'll be asked to enter the index of the text they wish to update (<strong>NOTE: Indexing starts from 0.</strong>).<br/>
-> As soon as the user enters a valid index and the new text in description box and clicks on the <strong>UPDATE</strong> button, the Update Count is increased and the new text can be seen in the card below.<br/>
-> The second div consists of static data with texts and image.
-> The project is successfully deployed in <strong>CI/CD manner on Heroku</strong>. Any further changes in the project will automatically be deployed and will be rendered as expected.
